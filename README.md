## About Me
I serve as a Research Associate at Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber-Physical Systems, Indian Institute of Science (IISC). My current project revolves around application of generative modelling in Energy Time series datasets.
My research interests focus on deep learning and generative modelling, emphasising its applications, such as anomaly detection. Furthermore, I am keenly interested in areas like model interpretability and representation learning.
